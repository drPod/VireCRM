Prefer Supabase CLI (`supabase ...`) over MCP `mcp__plugin_supabase_supabase__*` tools — CLI authenticated via `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `~/.zshrc`, costs no extra context tokens.

## Dev server + env

Vite bakes `VITE_*` env vars into the dev bundle at startup. After ANY `.env` edit (especially `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`), kill the running `vite dev` and restart — HMR will not pick up env changes. Symptom of a stale-env bundle: login silently fails with "invalid credentials" because the bundle is still pointing at an abandoned Supabase project. Use `scripts/restart-dev.sh` — it kills stray vite processes, prints the resolved `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, and starts a fresh `bun run dev`.
